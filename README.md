**COMING SOON**

Thanks for visiting my commercial example GitHub.

Once I have anonymised the data of clients I have completed tasks for in the past, I will be uploading model examples and HTML reports to showcase the type of work I can deliver.

Upcoming project examples include:

- Full weather API-integrated ML forecasting using Python and TensorFlow

- Stochastic probability risk assessment model: generating 10,000+ scenarios for price and volume variation to predict likely balancing costs and set fees

- FAISS/Langchain and Flask build providing the Regulations department with an app that allows them to upload thousands of regulatory documents and then ask questions directly to it, with answers being cited.

I can also create models on request. Please get in touch if you would like to see an example HTML output of statistical analysis in Python.
